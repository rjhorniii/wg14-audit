*** Setup plantuml to automatically generate SVG
    - Use javaw.exe -jar plantuml-1.2022.8.jar -tsvg -gui
      The "-tsvg" says to generate SVG
      The -gui brings up the window app that watches a requested directory.

    - 'javaw.exe -jar plantuml-1.2022.8.jar -tsvg <filename>' is the command
      line to convert a specific filename.

    - WSL/bash has issues with javaw.exe, this needs to be done in
      Powershell or command window.

*** Revisions to audit log used
    - What to use for RoleIDCode for the user
    - What to use for the code for the application process
    - Is there a coded value to use (rather than "12") that means URI.

      Should we make these changes to the example?  It's correct but
      rather old formulation for the codes.
